# rateLimit
this project implements a rate limit to limit the number of emails to the user of even a kind of notification


This project is to show how we could implement a rate limit,  used strategy  first thinking in different strategies for each type but comes into a solution with not necessary strategy, but  I left it because may be is useful in future implementation or completion.
also this project is able to run with docker using makefile commands.
